                COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. WHO learned of this new virus on December 31, 2019, when an outbreak of "viral pneumonia" cases was reported in Wuhan, People's Republic of China.

                For your safety, take a few simple precautions: maintain physical separation, wear a mask (especially when separation is not possible), ensure proper ventilation of rooms, avoid crowds and close contact, wash your hands regularly, and cough into your elbow or into a tissue. Follow local guidelines where you live and work. <strong>Take all these precautions! </strong>

                <span>While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. When testing capabilities are limited, priority should be given to testing those at greatest risk of infection, such as health care workers, and those most likely to develop a severe form of the disease, such as the elderly, especially those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.</span>

                <span>In most cases, a molecular test is used to screen for SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. The most commonly used molecular test is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. A swab is taken from the nose and/or throat. The molecular test detects the presence of the virus in the swab by amplifying the viral genetic material to detectable levels. Therefore, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may appear.

                <span>Rapid diagnostic antigen tests (also called rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are taken from the nose and/or throat using a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR tests and give a result more quickly, but they are generally less reliable. These tests are most effective when the virus is circulating widely in a community and when the sample is taken when the person is most contagious. </span>

                <span>Yes, there are three COVID-19 vaccines that have been licensed for use by some national regulatory authorities. None of them have yet received WHO emergency (EUL)/prequalification approval, but we expect an evaluation of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of December and for some of the other candidates soon after.  </span>
                <span>Large efficacy and safety studies of five vaccine candidates, including the three in question (the other two being Moderna and AstraZeneca), have been made public via press release, but only one company (AstraZeneca) has published results in a peer-reviewed journal. We expect to see more such reports in the near future. It is likely that other candidates will be submitted for regulatory approval.</span>
