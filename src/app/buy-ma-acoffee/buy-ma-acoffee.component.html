            <p>The goal behind the creation of this website has never been a way for me to make a lot of money, but keeping this website up to date, continually improving it and especially assuming the hosting costs generate costs that your donations will help me support.</p>
            <p> 
                The greatest joy for me would be to see my website grow, so feel free to share it if you find it useful and intuitive. I've put a lot of hours of work into it and I'd like to see that it wasn't all for nothing.</p>
